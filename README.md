# What is this project?

This is a NodeJS console based text editor.

## What is this project for?

Mostly for getting experience with design patterns, data structures and unique problems that I have not tackled before.

## What can I do in this editor?

Now you might be wondering what will you be able to do in this text editor?

- Write text!
- Cursor
  - Can move it up, down, left and right
  - Cursor movement to key text parts, such as spaces, tabs, underscores, dashes and more
  - Can use `home` and `end` keys to jump to beginning/end of line
- Select text and be able to replace/copy it
  - Integration with cursor movement
- Undo/Redo

That's it for the features I am planning to add now, but here are some potential ideas for improvement üòÅ

- Translate it to some lower level language such as C++
- Multi Cursors
- Ctrl + F ü§î
- Replace
